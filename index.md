### 1. Software artifacts are prone to errors
It does not matter how you'll implement your source code: it will suck for sure, somewhere, somehow.

### 2. Ctrl+C, ctrl+V
It does not matter how many best practices you will take: for sure you will copy and paste some stuff somewhere.  

### 3. Despite the technology used, it will get old
Angular 1 anyone?

### 4. Buy technical books
Once obsolete they will turn in useful monitor stands!

### 5. Final manifesto version
[Is this a final version?](it_depends.html)

### 6. The only thing that does not depend
Your project will contain bugs.
